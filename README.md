# Intro

This is my first attempt to learn exploiting modern 64bit binary
with all the protections, canary, pie, nx, turned on.

Note: my libc version 2.33, if any doesn't work for you should check this.

# Bypassing NX

To disable ASLR

```sh
sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space"
```

To compile the binary with only nx protection

```sh
make nx
```

Start the program

```sh
./start.sh
```

Run the exploit

```sh
chmod +x exploit.py
./exploit.py
```

More to come soon
